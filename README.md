Placing Bad - Image Placeholder
===============================

This site has been produced by Tom Clarke and Gary Fagan. We are 'slight' Breaking Bad fans and were surprised there wasn't a Breaking Bad placeholder service out there. So we decided to build one.
Enter 'Placing Bad'. With this placeholder service you can manufacture your site to the clients exact 'blue' specification.

Improvements
------------

Will we accept changes to the site. Yes. If you feel the service doesn't quite offer everything you want, you can create a ticket and if we think this is a good idea we will try to implement it.

So you want to contribute? That's cool too, fork a copy, make you changes and submit a merge request. We will review and if we like it, we will include it.
